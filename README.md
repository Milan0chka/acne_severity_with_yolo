# Acne Severity Classification with YOLOv8 and ML

This is a **student project** that replicates the approach from the paper  
*“Classification of Acne Severity Using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest Methods”* (Maitimua et al., 2025).

The project uses **YOLOv8** to detect acne lesions in facial images and extract simple numerical features (acne density, average confidence, number of detections).  
These features are then used to classify acne severity using **KNN** and **Random Forest** models, with **SMOTE** applied to handle class imbalance.

## Note
- Datasets and trained model weights are **not included**
